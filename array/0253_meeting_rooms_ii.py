253. Meeting Rooms II
Medium

Given an array of meeting time intervals consisting of start and end times [[s1,e1],[s2,e2],...] (si < ei), find the minimum number of conference rooms required.

Example 1:

Input: [[0, 30],[5, 10],[15, 20]]
Output: 2

Example 2:

Input: [[7,10],[2,4]]
Output: 1

NOTE: input types have been changed on April 15, 2019. Please reset to default code definition to get new method signature.

Solution 1: use sorting and a counter.

When a meeting (interval) starts, a new room is needed (possibly a previous
used one).  When a meeting (interval) ends, the room used is now available.
A room counter keeps track of how many rooms are being used at each moment.
The counter is incremented when a meeting starts, and decremented when a 
meeting ends.

Assume: If a meeting starts exactly when another ends, the room taken up
by the ending meet will be made free first.  In the solution, this corresponds 
to having start == end, but (end, -1) < (start, 1) so the ending meeting
is processed first.

O(n log n) time for sorting
O(n) extra space for "s" array

Solution 2: use sorting and a min heap of end times.

O(n log n) time: for sorting, and for O(n) heap pops and pushes, each of
which is an O(log n) operation.

O(n) extra space: for sorted array (if not modifying given array), and
for heap.
