81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
Medium

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., [0,0,1,2,2,5,6] might become [2,5,6,0,0,1,2]).

You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return true, otherwise return false.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,0,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: false
Follow up:

This is a follow up problem to Search in Rotated Sorted Array, where nums may contain duplicates.
Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
"""

from typing import List

"""
The worst case cannot be better than O(n) because all values might be
duplicates.  A simple linear scan can achieve this worst case time complexity,
but would be less efficient when there are not many duplicates, ie, is still
O(n) when there are no duplicates.  Modified binary search is O(log n) when 
there are no duplicates.

"""
Solution: same as for LC33, but update lo or high with mid only if we are
sure one side is sorted (by checking strict inequalities).  If we're not sure,
check target vs the ends, and update lo or high accordingly.

Even with duplicates, at least one side (left or right) must be sorted.
Because of duplicates, we cannot check if a side is sorted using non-strict
inequalities; eg, if arr[lo] <= arr[mid], it be something like 1 3 1 1 1.

However, we can check using a strict inequality:
arr[lo] < arr[mid] implies the left side is sorted;
arr[mid] < arr[hi] implies the right side is sorted.

If both strict inequalities do not hold, then we can't tell which side is
sorted.
arr[lo] >= arr[mid] >= arr[hi].

Example:
1 3 1 1 1 search left
1 1 1 3 1 search right
lo <= mid <= hi
