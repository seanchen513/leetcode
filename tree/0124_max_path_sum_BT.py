124. Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
Hard

Given a non-empty binary tree, find the maximum path sum.

For this problem, a path is defined as any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The path must contain at least one node and does not need to go through the root.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3]

       1
      / \
     2   3

Output: 6

Example 2:

Input: [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]

   -10
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

Output: 42

Solution: postorder recursion.  Need to track 2 things: 
(1) max sums of non-V-shaped paths (call these arrows), and 
(2) max sums of possibly V-shaped paths.  

Since the latter is global to the recursion, we make it nonlocal (could also 
be a class var; or just include it as another return value).

The former is used to update the latter for each node, and is passed up
to its parent.  Since paths don't need to reach down to the leaves,
and in order to maximize sums, we don't let arrows have negative sums
(take an empty arrow with 0 sum instead).

Here we make 0 a lower bound of the return value with max(0, *).
Alternatively, we can do the same thing with the recursive calls:
    left_arrow = max(0, dfs(node.left))
    right_arrow = max(0, dfs(node.right))

O(n) time
O(h) extra space for recursion
