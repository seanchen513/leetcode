1143. Longest Common Subsequence
Medium

Given two strings text1 and text2, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters(can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters. (eg, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not). A common subsequence of two strings is a subsequence that is common to both strings.

If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

Example 1:

Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.

Example 2:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.

Example 3:

Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
 
Constraints:

1 <= text1.length <= 1000
1 <= text2.length <= 1000
The input strings consist of lowercase English characters only.

Solution: DP, recursion w/ memoization via functools.lru_cache().

Let dp[i][j] = length of longest common subsequence of
s1(0..i) = s1[:i+1] and 
s2(0..j) = s2[:j+1].

dp[i][j] 
= dp[i-1][j-1] + 1              if s1[i] == s2[j]
= max( dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j] ) if s1[i] != s2[j]

(i, j) = (i-1, j-1) + 1
(i, j) = max[(i-1, j), (i, j-1)]

Boundary conditions:

dp[i][0] = length of longest common subsequence of s1(0..i) and ch := s2[0].
Equal to 0 until the first char in s1 that equals ch.
Then equals 1 for the rest of s1.

dp[0][j] = length of longest common subsequence of ch := s1[0] and s2(0..j).
Equal to 0 until the first char in s2 that equals ch.
Then equals 1 for the rest of s2.

DP relations reduce to:
dp[i][0] = 1            if s1[i] == s2[0]
dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]   if s1[i] != s2[0]

dp[0][j] = 1            if s1[0] == s2[j]
dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]   if s1[0] != s2[j]

Basically, set dp[i][j] to 0 if i == -1 or j == -1.
