1008. Construct Binary Search Tree from Preorder Traversal
Medium

Return the root node of a binary search tree that matches the given preorder traversal.

(Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any descendant of node.left has a value < node.val, and any descendant of node.right has a value > node.val.  Also recall that a preorder traversal displays the value of the node first, then traverses node.left, then traverses node.right.)

Example 1:

Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]

Note: 

1 <= preorder.length <= 100
The values of preorder are distinct.

Solution 2: preorder recursion on start and end indices of preorder array
for current subtree.

First element of preorder is the root.  Then come the values for the left
subtree, which are all smaller than the root.  Then come the values for the 
right subtree, which are all bigger than the root.

O(n log n) time if use binary search and pass around array indices

Binary search
    O(log n) for first search.
    This is done once for every node that is constructed.
    So total time for binary search is at most O(n log n).

If pass around array copies (slicing), and used binary search:
    Copying for left and right halves together is O(n).
    This is done once for every node that is constructed.
    So total time for array copying is at most O(n^2).

Note: can pass around modified "end" index that is 1 more than regular one.
