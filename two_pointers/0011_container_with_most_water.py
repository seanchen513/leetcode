11. Container With Most Water
Medium

Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Note: You may not slant the container and n is at least 2.

The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

Example:

Input: [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
Output: 49

Solution: use 2 pointers for left and right side of containers.

Start with max width container.  For side with smaller height, move side
inwards until a higher height is found, and check volume of new container.

Note: if both sides are the same height, it doesn't matter which side is
moved first.  The only way to get a container of greater volume is for
both sides to be moved eventually.  Can modify code to take this case
into consideration.
